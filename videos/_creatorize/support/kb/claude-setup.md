Creatorize uses **your own Claude Code** with your own Claude plan, so it has to be installed on this computer and signed in.

## Install Claude Code

1. Open **Settings > System > System check**. If the Claude Code line says "Claude Code is not installed", click **Copy install command**.
2. Run it:
   - On Windows, in PowerShell: `irm https://claude.ai/install.ps1 | iex`
   - On Mac, in Terminal: `curl -fsSL https://claude.ai/install.sh | bash`
3. Restart Creatorize Suite.

Already installed but the app can't find it? Find its path (On Windows, in PowerShell: `where.exe claude` / On Mac, in Terminal: `which claude`) and paste it into **Settings > System > Tool paths**, in the **claude** field.

## Sign in

1. Go to **Settings > AI engines > Claude** and click **Sign in with Claude** (or **Sign in** under **Connect Claude** on Home).
2. A Claude sign-in page opens in your browser. Click **Authorize** there, then come back to the app.
3. Browser didn't open? Click **Open the sign-in page**.
4. Seeing a page with a code? Paste the code into the field in Settings and click **Send code**.

When it works, Settings says **Signed in (Claude subscription)** and the button at the bottom of the sidebar says **Claude connected**. That button ("Claude not signed in" when you are not) always opens this setting.

## "Sign in again" in the Claude panel

Your sign-in ran out. Click **Sign in again** and finish the steps above.

## "API key, billed as API credit"

Claude Code is signed in with an API key, so your edits cost API credit. Click **Sign out**, then **Sign in with Claude** to use your Claude plan instead.

## Still stuck?

In **Settings > General > Workspace** click **Copy diagnostics**, then click **Help > Report a problem** so it gets fixed.
