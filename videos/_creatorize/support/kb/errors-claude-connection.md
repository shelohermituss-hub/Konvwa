## Claude Code is not installed
> Claude Code is not installed. Install it ...
> ... then restart the Suite.

What it means: the app can't find Claude Code on this computer. It uses your own Claude Code and Claude plan.

Fix:
1. On Windows, in PowerShell: `irm https://claude.ai/install.ps1 | iex`. On Mac, in Terminal: `curl -fsSL https://claude.ai/install.sh | bash`
2. Restart Creatorize Suite.
3. Already installed? On Windows run `where.exe claude` in PowerShell; on Mac run `which claude` in Terminal. Paste the path it prints into **Settings > System > Tool paths** (the claude field).

## Claude is not signed in
> Claude is not signed in (or its sign-in ran out). Sign in with Claude in Settings > AI engines, then try again.

Fix:
1. Open **Settings > AI engines** and click **Sign in with Claude**.
2. Finish the sign-in in your browser, then try again.

## An API key with no credit
> Claude Code is signed in with an Anthropic API key that has no credit left, not your Claude plan.

Fix: in **Settings > AI engines** click **Sign out**, then **Sign in with Claude**.

## Sign-in could not be refreshed
> Claude Code could not refresh its sign-in because another Claude Code process was doing the same.

Fix:
1. Wait a minute and try again.
2. Keeps happening? Close other Claude Code windows, or sign in again in **Settings > AI engines**.

## Could not reach Claude
> Could not reach Claude. Check your internet connection and try again.

Fix: check the internet connection. A VPN, firewall or antivirus can block it too: allow Creatorize Suite there.

## A tool can't be started
> ... was not found on this computer. Install it, or set its path in Settings > System > Tool paths.
> ... is not allowed to run (no permission to execute it).
> ... could not be started: a folder in its path is actually a file.

Fix:
1. Open **Settings > System > System check**: missing tools show their install command. Install, restart the app, press **Run checks**.
2. Not allowed to run: reinstall that tool.
3. Check the paths in **Settings > System > Tool paths** (an empty field means found automatically).
