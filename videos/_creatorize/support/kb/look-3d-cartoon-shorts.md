**3D cartoon shorts**: big-headed 3D cartoon characters with faces that change on the words, in busy dressed sets.
In **New project**, pick the style, then **Engine**:

- **Three.js**: renders live in the app. Instant previews, quick exports.
- **Blender**: renders in Blender, which runs hidden. Richer light, depth of field, motion blur and denser sets
  (the look of the showcase shorts). You never open Blender yourself.

Both make **Vertical 9:16** or **Wide 16:9** (the **Format** switch).

## Blender: quality

Picked in New project, changeable in the **Build** dialog:

- **Standard**: one Claude session builds and checks every shot. The fastest and lightest on your Claude plan.
- **Verified**: adds a frame-by-frame check of every scene.
- **Ultraedit**: the studio method: several builders work at once, a critic reviews every shot, a second round
  fixes what it found. The best result, the most Claude usage. It runs on the model and effort picked for the
  project (Claude panel or Project settings); with none picked, Opus 5.5 at High.

## Blender: preview

Under the preview, **Solid** is a light, fast shading for scrubbing; **Look** shows the real light when the playhead
rests. Play runs from frames made in the background. Click a character or prop to select it for Claude.

## Blender: installing it

Creatorize installs Blender itself the first time you need it (the official build from blender.org, about 400 MB,
once): **Install Blender** in New project, or by itself when you create the project or open its preview.
The preview starts when it's done.

**Mac**: Blender 5.2 needs a Mac with Apple silicon (M1 or newer). On an Intel Mac, use the Three.js engine.

## Blender: exporting takes longer

Blender renders every frame for real: on a fast graphics card a 1-minute short takes about 15-50 minutes (busy night
scenes are the slow end), on a laptop several times longer. Frames already rendered are kept, so exporting again
after a small change only renders the shots that changed.
