The **YouTube** page (sidebar, under Analytics; Premium) reads your numbers through your own free Google Cloud project. It takes about ten minutes, once.

## Two levels
- **Public stats** (subscribers, views, likes, comments of any channel): guide steps 1 to 3, then **Follow a channel**.
- **Full analytics** of your own channels (watch time, how long people watch, where they come from): all six steps, then **Sign in with Google**.

## The Setup guide
Click **Setup guide** on the YouTube page (or open **Settings > YouTube**):
1. **Make a Google Cloud project**: **Open Google Cloud**, sign in with your YouTube Google account, name it, Create. No billing needed.
2. **Switch on the two YouTube APIs**: open **YouTube Data API v3** and **YouTube Analytics API**, click **Enable** on each.
3. **Public stats: make an API key**: on Credentials, **Create credentials > API key**, paste it, **Save key**.
4. **Full analytics: set up the sign-in screen**: in **Google Auth Platform** click **Get started**, choose **External**, then under **Audience** add your Google account as a test user. Click **Publish app**, or Google signs you out after 7 days.
5. **Make the sign-in client**: on **Clients**, **Create client**, type **Desktop app**. Drop the downloaded JSON file in the guide (or paste the client ID and secret), then **Save client**.
6. **Sign in with Google**.

If the guide says the app has a Google sign-in built in, skip steps 4 and 5.

## Signing in
Your browser opens Google's sign-in (**Waiting for Google…**; **Open the page again** reopens it). Pick the account that owns the channel and allow both permissions. "Google hasn't verified this app": it is your own app, click **Advanced**, then **Go to** your app.
- One channel per sign-in: sign in once for each channel.
- A channel you only manage through YouTube Studio permissions can't be read: use the account that owns it.
- Then pick which of your Creatorize channels it is (see "Channels: make, edit and link a channel").

Keys and sign-ins are stored encrypted on this computer.

## Follow a channel
**Follow a channel** (or **+**): an @handle, a youtube.com/@handle address or a channel ID. Any public channel: yours, or one you learn from.
