platforms: both

## Routines are Premium
> Routines is a Premium feature. Upgrade to Premium on Skool to unlock it.

Fix: upgrade to Premium on Skool.

## A node is in the wrong place
> There is no project yet: put a Create project before this node.
> There is no script to read: put Write script (or My script) before it.
> The narration is not ready (cleaned and timed). Put Voiceover (or Clean audio + Time words) before it.
> There is no rendered video: put a Render before it.

Fix: add the node the message names before this one, then run the routine again.

## No voice set up
> No voice is set up: add an ElevenLabs or Fish Audio key, or install the local voice (Settings > Media > Voiceover).
> Pick an ElevenLabs voice in this node...

Fix: add a key or install the local voice in **Settings > Media > Voiceover**, then pick a voice in the node.

## Not enough words heard
> ... % of the script's words were heard when it was timed ...

What it means: the voiceover does not match the script well enough for the check in this node.

Fix: retry this video, or lower the needed percentage in the node.

## Claude's answer was not usable
> Claude gave no title. Retry this video.
> Claude wrote a title the channel already has ...
> ... Retry this video.
> Claude answered in an unexpected format...

Fix: retry this video.

## Upload node
> Pick the YouTube channel in this node.
> This channel has not allowed uploads: select the node and press Allow uploads.

Fix: select the node, pick the channel and press **Allow uploads**.

## Import
> That file is not a routine exported from Creatorize Suite.

Fix: import a routine file that was exported from the app.

## Claude's limits stop a routine
> Your Claude usage limit is reached...

What it means: your Claude plan's limit (or sign-in) stopped the routine, not the routine itself.

Fix: wait until the limit resets, then resume the routine. See "Claude edit errors and usage limits".
