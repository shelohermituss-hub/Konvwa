**Settings > System > System check** lists everything the app needs. A missing tool only switches off the steps that use it. Click **Run checks** (top of Settings) to check again.

## A line says "Not found"

1. Click **Copy install command** on that line.
2. Run it (On Windows: in PowerShell / On Mac: in Terminal), then click **Run checks**. Still "Not found"? Restart the app.

| Line | What you see if missing | On Windows (PowerShell) | On Mac (Terminal) |
|---|---|---|---|
| Claude Code | Claude Code is not installed | `irm https://claude.ai/install.ps1 \| iex` | `curl -fsSL https://claude.ai/install.sh \| bash` |
| Git (edit history) | Not found: edits cannot be reverted | `winget install --id Git.Git -e` | `xcode-select --install` |
| ffmpeg (export) | Not found: export cannot add audio / mux | `winget install --id Gyan.FFmpeg -e` | `brew install ffmpeg` |
| Python (audio) | Not found: audio pipeline disabled | `winget install --id Python.Python.3.12 -e` | `brew install python` |
| Node.js (intro edits) | Not found: Claude cannot render edited intros | `winget install --id OpenJS.NodeJS.LTS -e` | `brew install node` |

On a Mac, ffmpeg and Python install with Homebrew. No Homebrew yet? Get it from brew.sh first.

## Other lines

- **Python packages**: "Missing …" with an **Install** button: click it. If it says **Install (~2 GB with PyTorch)**, that download is large.
- **Smart App Control** (Windows only): **On** blocks transcription and the audio steps; its (?) says what to do. See "Transcription and audio step errors".
- **Creatorize Launcher**: **Installed** with its version, or **Not installed** (Creatorize installs it in the background). **Removed by your antivirus**: click **How to get it back** (see "Your antivirus blocks or removes Creatorize").
- **Claude Code** "Not signed in": see "Claude not installed or not signed in".
- **Transcription**: see "Transcription setup (word timing)".

## Installed, but still "Not found"

Tell the app where the tool is in **Settings > System > Tool paths** (see "Tool paths").

## Still red?

In **Settings > General > Workspace** click **Copy diagnostics**, then click **Help > Report a problem** so it gets fixed.
